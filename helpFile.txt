Welcome to SoundBytes!

HOW TO MAKE MUSIC:
Click on the buttons on the left side of the screen to hear what audio
samples you can play.

If you like a particular sample, click on a new line beneath this help
guide and write 'add <samplename>' using the same sample name as on the
button. For example, if you wanted to add the bass(fat) sample you would
type 'add bass(fat)'.

Either click on the RUN button or use the hotkey CTRL + 'R' to play the
sample/s you have added.

If you want to add another sample, click on a new line and use the add
and run commands again.

Other commands:
- 'set <samplename> volume x' will change the volume for that sample to
  the value of x (which can be between 0 to 11).
- 'remove <samplename>' will stop that sample from playing. If you want
  to add it again, use the add command.
- 'stop' will stop all samples from playing.

HOW TO SAVE YOUR MUSIC:
Click on the save button to save the samples you have added. After saving
the .lump file in a folder of your choice, click on the button with the
folder icon to find and load your file.
