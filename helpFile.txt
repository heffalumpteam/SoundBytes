RUN button or use the hotkey CTRL + 'R' to initialise the program.

HOW TO MAKE MUSIC:
Click on the buttons on the left side of the screen to hear what
audio samples you can play.

If you like a particular sample, write 'add <samplename>' using the
same sample name as on the button. For example, if you wanted to
add the bass(fat) sample you would type 'add bass(fat)'.

Use the run command to play the sample/s you have added.

If you want to add another sample, click on a new line and use the
add and run commands again.

Other commands:
- 'set <samplename> volume x' will change the volume for that
  sample to the value of x (which can be between 0 to 11).
- 'remove <samplename>' will stop that sample from playing.
  If you want to add it again, use the add command.
- 'stop' will stop all samples from playing.

HOW TO SAVE YOUR MUSIC:
Click on the save button to save the samples you have added.
After saving the .lump file in a folder of your choice, click on
the button with the folder icon to find and load your file.
